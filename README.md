# mockups
We've developed a PWA for to create garment mockups. Users can upload images (background, garment, logos, watermark) and adjust them on a pre-defined canvas. The app allows for free dragging, resizing, and reordering of layers. The final design can be exported as a PNG, JPG, or PDF. It's an all-in-one, professional design tool.
